# Problem: 
Create a Template Engine

## Explaining the Problem:
1. **What is a Template Engine?**
    - Template engines are tools to separate program-logic and presentation into two independent parts. This makes the development of both logic and presentation easier, improves flexibility and eases modification and maintenance.
    - A specialised form of "code generation". 
    - Django has its own templating Language. Another example is Jinja.
2. Examples: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/templates/

## Scope of the Problem:
1. Support for:
    - Variables
    - Common data structures and objects
    - if
    - for
    - Comments
2. Non-functional goodness?
    - Surprise me

## Good Design:
1. Is easy to extend
2. Intuitive, and easy to reason about
3. Takes the right tradeoffs â†’ performance vs readability, complexity vs reducing scope.

## Expectations Order:
1. Best effort design, and covers edge cases
2. The design is coded with stubs
3. Stubs are implemented and the code works!
4. The code is optimised for performance

## How to go about the session:
1. Do whatever you want to solve the problem, go out of the room, use paper-pen, use sheets (go to the internet? Although there won't be any need for that). Just don't search for "How to make a template engine".
2. I am available for all discussions. Ask me doubts, scope problems, design ideas. I will be available for all of that. **But try, as much as possible, to come to me with multiple problems instead of coming once for each problem.** Solve the problem maturely.
3. Do not discuss things amongst yourselves because then you might get biased.
4. Timelines are known. At 11:00 we will meet and discuss solutions, and we will put up questions to each other.
